# DWA Starter React

Decentralized Web App: it's a Web5 Progressive Web App.

## Why PWA?

It's a perfect match with Web5 DWNs since a PWA can work offline and DWN has a synced local storage.

Aside from that, the advanced PWA capabilities such as modifying fetch requests allow us to extract the most such as displaying images with DRLs in the traditional `src` attribute.

## Introduction

Orient users to the project here. This is a good place to start with an assumption
that the user knows very little - so start with the Big Picture and show how this
project fits into it. It may be good to reference/link the broader architecture in the
`collaboration` repo or the developer site here.

Then maybe a dive into what this project does.

Diagrams and other visuals are helpful here. Perhaps code snippets showing usage.

Project leads should complete, alongside this `README`:
